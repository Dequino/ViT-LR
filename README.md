# ViT-LR
A latent replay model using Vision Transformer (ViT) as backbone

## Usage
Requires the AR1 conda enviroment found [here](https://github.com/vlomonaco/ar1-pytorch) and the Core50 database found [here](https://github.com/vlomonaco/core50).

Edit the Code50 root folder path in the source code when creating the database object.

```
python3 test.py
```

Prints the model structure and parameters.

```
python3 vitlr.py
```

Trains the model on the Core50 dataset, nicv2_391 scenario. A tensorboard logs folder and a state dict will be generated.

```
python3 vitlr_stats.py
```

Prints the average training speed of single image batch

Jupyter notebooks:
1. Confusion matrix
Prints the confusion matrix of a trained model, requires the output state dict generated by vitlr.py
2. Attention rollout
Prints a visual representation of the attention rollout, mostly experimental, requires a state dict.

## How to edit the model
